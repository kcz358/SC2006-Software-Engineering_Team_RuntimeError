### Project description

RecycleBean is a new, self-contained product that our team has designed. The diagram below is the Use Case Diagram that we have created. It illustrates how each use case interacts with other use cases and external actors.

1. RecyleBean aims to promote sustainable waste management in Singapore, by providing a one-stop application with multiple functionalities, to our users. Effectively, RecycleBean aims to achieve the following intent:

2. Increase Awareness and Proliferate Information. Within RecycleBean, we provide an information and article portal that is targeted at educating our users on the benefits of sustainable waste management. Through this portal, our users can learn more about the appropriate methods of waste management and how to contribute to our fight against global warming.

3. Facilitate Locating Appropriate Waste Bins. We provide a landing page that allows users to locate waste bins, based on different categories. Users are given an option to search for these waste bins based on their current location; or through inputting a specific location through the search bar provided. A myriad of waste bin locations will be displayed, with more information provided when users click into each bin displayed.

4. Build a Culture of Sharing. We provide a feedback page that allows our community of users to share feedback about the bins that they used so that others may know the condition of the bins before they visit them.
